<h1 align="center" id="title">Random Foxes with React & TypeScript</h1>
This is a refactor verion of my main To Do App, here I chosed a different way of state managing, instead of using useState inside each component I abstracted so all the props, and state setters can be send from the App Component directly, so we can have a more readable code
